        The term "もんだいようし" (問題用紙) is a compound word made up of two parts: 問題 (もんだい, mondai) and 用紙 (ようし, youshi).

問題 (mondai) means "problem" or "question." It refers to a task, question, or issue, especially in the context of exams or tests.
用紙 (youshi) means "paper" or "sheet." It refers to a piece of paper, often one that has something written or printed on it.
So, 問題用紙 (もんだいようし, mondai youshi) means "test paper" or "question sheet," specifically the paper on which the questions or problems of a test are written.

From a grammatical perspective, it is a compound noun formed by joining two nouns, "問題" (problem) and "用紙" (paper), which together convey the idea of a paper with problems written on it (like a test paper or question sheet).

Example in English:

問題用紙 = "Test paper" or "Question sheet"
This is a common structure in Japanese, where two nouns combine to form a new meaning.
